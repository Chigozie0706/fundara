## Project Overview

Fundara aims to revolutionize disaster management by decentralizing how reports are created and maintained. The platform uses Ethereum's Solidity language to implement a smart contract that securely stores disaster data, including:

- **Type**
- **Location**
- **Severity**
- **Media attachments (images)**

### Key Benefits:

1. **Data Integrity:** Reports are uniquely linked to the reporterâ€™s wallet address, ensuring ownership and accountability.
2. **Transparency:** Disaster data is stored immutably on the blockchain.
3. **User Control:** Only the original reporter can modify or delete their reports or associated media.
4. **Web3 Adoption:** Introduces users to the benefits of blockchain technology, addressing content-sharing limitations of Web2 platforms.

## Features

- **Create Reports:** Submit disaster reports with details such as type, location, severity, and images.
- **Update Reports:** Attach additional images with timestamps for better disaster tracking.
- **Delete Reports:** Ensure users retain full control over their submitted data.
- **Real-Time Interactions:** A React.js frontend provides seamless interaction with the blockchain.
- **Comprehensive Overview:** Total disaster reports are tracked and easily retrievable for analysis.
